## About Me

I’m a pragmatic Computer Science student with a strong interest in **backend systems, low-level programming, and developer tooling**.  
I enjoy working close to the system, understanding how things work under the hood, and building software that is efficient, maintainable, and practical.

I’m most comfortable designing and implementing:
- Backend services and application logic in .NET
- Performance-critical utilities and tools in C and Rust
- Desktop applications with clean, functional UI
- Systems that emphasize correctness, clarity, and long-term maintainability

My long-term goal is to grow into a **systems-oriented software engineer** with strong foundations in operating systems, security, and software architecture.

## Technical Focus

- **Languages:** C, C#, Rust  
- **Frameworks & Platforms:** .NET (ASP.NET Core), Avalonia UI  
- **Databases:** MySQL, SQLite, Firebase  
- **Game / Simulation:** Godot  
- **Interests:** systems programming, backend architecture, security fundamentals, compiler theory

## Security & CTFs

I actively participate in **CTF competitions and security challenges** to strengthen my understanding of:
- Low-level behavior and memory
- Reverse engineering and binary analysis
- Web and application security concepts
- Practical problem-solving under constraints
